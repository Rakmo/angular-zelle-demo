# ZelleTransfer

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.6.

This application demonstrates:

1. All the CRUD operations using Angular including form field validations with RegEx patterns, Json-server (fake server) for adding a recipient for Zelle Transfer.
2. Tab navigation in Angular
3. Basic animations

NOTE: This doesn't contain any actual Zelle API integration.

## Steps if you fork this:

1. Run `npm install` so that all the dependecies are installed
2. To start the local server: `npm run start-server` in one terminal window. Server should be started at http://localhost:5000/
3. In another terminal window, run first: `ng build` and then `ng serve`. Application can be accessed at http://localhost:4200/

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
